Client Summary and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial, a trusted financial services organization, needed a highly secure software application to protect sensitive customer information and ensure safe financial transactions. Their main concerns were software security vulnerabilities, particularly related to insecure dependencies, weak cryptographic practices, and the transmission of unverified data. By addressing these issues, Artemis Financial aimed to enhance their software's security and safeguard their customers' data.
Identifying Vulnerabilities and the Importance of Secure Coding
I excelled in identifying software security vulnerabilities through static analysis and dependency checks, successfully analyzing third-party libraries for known risks. Secure coding is essential for preventing data breaches, protecting customer trust, and minimizing financial and legal risks. It adds value by ensuring regulatory compliance, system reliability, and long-term business continuity.
Challenges and Insights from the Vulnerability Assessment
The toughest part of the vulnerability assessment was interpreting dependency-check reports and identifying high-risk vulnerabilities. However, it helped me prioritize risks and better understand real-world security implications.
Increasing Security Layers and Future Assessment Approaches
I enhanced security by using cryptographic hashing, HTTPS with SSL/TLS, and certificate-based communication, while also addressing vulnerable dependencies. In the future, I will continue using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis, and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and determine suitable mitigation strategies.
Ensuring Functionality and Security After Refactoring
To maintain application functionality and security after refactoring, I conducted build verification, checksum validation, and vulnerability re-scans. Dependency checks confirmed that no new vulnerabilities were introduced, ensuring that security improvements did not affect performance.
Tools, Resources, and Practices for Future Use
Key tools from this project included Java Keytool for certificate generation, Maven dependency-check plugins, cryptographic hash verification, and secure coding standards. These will be valuable for future coursework and professional development.
Demonstrating Skills to Future Employers
I could showcase this assignment to future employers as proof of my skills in identifying security risks, applying cryptographic solutions, securely refactoring code, and validating secure communications. It highlights my practical experience in secure software development and compliance with industry best practices.
